SCALES-NLP Documentation
========================

**SCALES-NLP** is an AI toolkit for legal research that includes a collection 
of deep learning models that can perform the following tasks:

   - Classify docket entries with 60+ labels
   - Identify case openings and dispositive events
   - Disambiguate and classify legal entities

You can use our inference pipelines with our collection of pretrained 
models, or use our training rountines to create your own.

This work is part of `SCALES-OKN <https://scales-okn.org/>`_.  To learn more about this
