nysd;;1:16-cv-06077,"MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute and for counsel's failure to comply with numerous orders of the Court. In dismissing this case, the Court echoes an observation made by Judge Brian Cogan of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York last year in another ADA accessibility case brought by Plaintiff's counsel: ""The Court understands that plaintiff's counsel runs these cases on a volume basis and that is her business, but she must utilize reasonable process to get each case moving before this Court and cannot allow these scenarios to repeat themselves anymore. It is almost as if she is deliberately filing papers that cannot move the case forward in order to unreasonably delay it. Whether deliberate or not, she has to stop it, both in this case and in the others that she brings before this Court."" Taylor v. Happy M.E.W.S. Inc., No. 15-cv-5410 (BMC) (Dkt. No. 13). The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate all pending motions and to close this case. The Clerk of Court is further directed to send a copy of this order to Defendant by certified mail.
